RCOMP 2019-2020 Project - Sprint 2 review
=========================================
### Sprint master: 1171611 ###
(This file is to be created/edited by the sprint master only)
# 1. Sprint's backlog #
- Development of a layer two and layer three Packet Tracer simulation for building A, and also encompassing the campus backbone. Integration of every members’ Packet Tracer simulations into a single simulation.
- Development of a layer two and layer three Packet Tracer simulation for building B, and also encompassing the campus backbone.
- Development of a layer two and layer three Packet Tracer simulation for building C, and also encompassing the campus backbone.
- Development of a layer two and layer three Packet Tracer simulation for building D, and also encompassing the campus backbone.
- Development of a layer two and layer three Packet Tracer simulation for building E, and also encompassing the campus backbone.

# 2. Subtasks assessment #
One by one, each team member presents his/her outcomes to the team, the team assesses 		the accomplishment of the subtask backlog.
The subtask backlog accomplishment can be assessed as one of:

  * Totally implemented with no issues
  * Totally implemented with issues
  * Partially implemented with no issues
  * Partially implemented with issues

For the last three cases, a text description of what has not been implemented and present issues must be added.
Unimplemented features and issues solving is assigned to the same member on the next sprint.
